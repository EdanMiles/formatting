Formatting userform + backend for excel

####
A VBA userform offering a selection of quick actions to make formatting an excel worksheet easier.
Contains:
Section dividers
Formats for table headers
Formats for accounting, multiples, percentages and percentage growth (all with selectable decimal places).

N.B. for the latter set of formats, clicking the button will apply the default (as represented on the button itself), whereas using the keybind (also on the key)
allows zero decimal places (tap) or more (hold, and follow the prompts).
